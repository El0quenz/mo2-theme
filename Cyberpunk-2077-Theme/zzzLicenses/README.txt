I'm too lazy to make a pretty read me. 

Basically, check out the other licenses if you want to reuse the fonts or certain SVGs from this.
Don't be shitty.

All the SVGs that are NOT by Valency Graphics (which is most of them) were hand-created by me, using screenshots of in-game UI assets as guides.
All credit for the design of these icons goes to CDPR.

I am a beginner with SVG icons, so if you're the type to crack them open and notice how sloppy they are...
...feel free to fix them up and and send them my way and I will update the files for download :)

I think that's it. Enjoy!
